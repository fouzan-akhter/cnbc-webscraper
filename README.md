The following loops retrieve information from the HTML file, including each article's title, author, content type, date, content, and link. Prior to running the code, make sure the internet is active. Included for effective time management during code execution is a tqdm loadbar. A pandas dataframe will hold all of the extracted data. The max_links_to_collect informs the code of how many articles to scrape.
